# Description
A player usually stays in the game by expanding their realm over other realms to eat them, until theyâ€™ve reached a point where no one can contest their authority over Carnage.
A realm without territory ceases to exist. If the ruler vanishes, another ruler takes the throne.
A realm can only be controlled by one ruler at a time.
