# Description
A resource can be of three types:
* **COMPUTED** : The resource is read only, updated as frequently as possible, and gathered from other game elements
* **CENTERED** : The resource has a precise range and 0 represents perfect balance in this resource
* **CUMULATIVE** : The resource has no limit or a high limit and is accumulated overtime, then spent. They cannot support modifiers.
