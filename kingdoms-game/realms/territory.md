<!-- SUBTITLE: A quick summary of Territory -->

# Description
Each realm has a territory, which is their ensemble of controlled [Regions](/kingdoms-game/map/region).

## Capital region
The capital region is a region that is central to the realm's management, and house of the Ruler of that Realm.
When it is taken by another realm :
* Another currently controlled region becomes the new capital region
* A random number of [Treasures](/kingdoms-game/realms/treasure) is lost, randomly between **50 and 100%** of them.
* Morale loses **3 points** permanently until the capital region is recovered.
