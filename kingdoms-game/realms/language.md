<!-- SUBTITLE: A quick summary of Language -->

# Description
Each realm has their own language, which is the language mainly used by their people and ruler. If two rulers or characters speak a different language, they will have to use an interpret or learn a new language to understand each other correctly.
Travelers usually know a multitude of languages, as they travel. The same is true for the rulers who received any education. 
# Characteristics
A language is defined by three characteristics :
* **Alphabet** - A character that does not know a language with the same alphabet will be unable to read the language at all
* **Root** - A character that does not know a language with the same root will be unable to understand the meaning of the words and the structure of sentences
* **Form** - A character that does not know a language with the same form will mix up some words and their meaning's understanding might be altered
