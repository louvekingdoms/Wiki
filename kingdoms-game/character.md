# Description
Travelers and rulers are both different types of Character. Therefore, they share a lot of traits.
## Definition
A character is defined by:
* Their type (Ruler or Traveler)
* A set of [characteristics](/kingdoms-game/character/characteristics) : Numeric values that define the main aspects of the character. 
* [A name](/kingdoms-game/character/name)
* [A race](/kingdoms-game/race) : In case of a ruler, if it is different from the race they rule, negative effects occur. 
* [Traits](/kingdoms-game/character/traits) : A few traits taken from a predefined list â€“ some can be acquired at birth, other throughout the life of the character or during special events
* Other details like age, health

## On the map
Characters are represented on the map. Depending on the region they're positioned in, they can influence battles, be subject to events or interact with other characters.
See [Traveler movement](/kingdoms-game/character/traveler#map) and [Ruler movement](/kingdoms-game/character/ruler#map)
# Age
The ruler ages with time. Few realms have a ruler less than 18 or 20 years old, as it takes time to build shoulders solid enough to carry such responsibility.
As the age increases, the health decreases.
# Health
## Description
The character's health evoles with age, by a random value each year depending on other events. When a character's health is too damage, they die and are eliminated.
## Behavior
Damage works with a system of **wounds**: each character can only take so many wounds before dying. 
The maximum number of wounds a character can take depends on the character (on the class if they're travelers) and on their age.

(insert curve here, during most of their life a ruler can only take 3 wounds)
