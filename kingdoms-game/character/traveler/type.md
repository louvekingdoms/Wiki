# Types
## Legendary warrior
A legendary warrior is worth hundreds of soldiers in a battle. With him on the kingdom’s side, any battle fought will see its soldier count artificially increased by `+100*Prestige of the traveller`. 
However, any battle lost with the Legendary warrior on your side will decrease his prestige, and his relation with the ruler. The warrior also has a small chance to perish in combat.
## Wizard
A wizard can help the ruler and the kingdom in numerous ways, among which healing soldiers (allowing to recover Army faster), predict the outcome of battles and influence them, increase a region’s wealth, create forests, build megaliths/temples terrifying the enemy troops, or contact other travellers or rulers with magic signals. 
## Vagabond
A vagabond can be offered shelter and food and easily convince to pledge allegence to the Kingdom – however, this will reduce prestige instead of increasing it. During his presence, the vagabond will drain wealth and maybe cause some troubles. But eventually after a while, he will turn into another type of traveller with a high prestige – or not
