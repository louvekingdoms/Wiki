# Description
Travelers and rulers are both different types of Character. Therefore, they share a lot of traits.
## Definition
A character is defined by:
* Their type (Ruler or Traveler)
* [A name](1-kingdoms-game/1-1-character/1-1-2-name)
* [A race](1-kingdoms-game/1-1-race)
* [Traits](1-kingdoms-game/1-1-character/1-1-3-traits)
* Other details like age, health, and time since crowned
# Age
The ruler ages with time. Few kingdoms have a ruler less than 18 or 20 years old, as it takes time to build shoulders solid enough to carry such responsibility.
As the age increases, the health decreases.
# Health
## Description
The character's health evoles with age, by a random value each year depending on other events. When a character's health is too damage, they die and are eliminated.
## Behavior
Damage works with a system of **wounds**: each character can only take so many wounds before dying. 
The maximum number of wounds a character can take depends on the character (on the class if they're travelers) and on their age.

(insert curve here, during most of their life a ruler can only take 3 wounds)
