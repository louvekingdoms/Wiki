# Pitch
Kingdoms is a multiplayer social-based strategy game in which each player rules over a province-sized kingdom, all in the same region. The goal is to gain control over the region itself.

A ruler alone can only do so much, but powerful characters and mystic beasts inhabit or are travelling through the region - learn to know them, befriend some, and they will turn into powerful allies. 

With the power of territorial expansion▲, controlled aggression ×, and friendship♥, the first ruler to make a solid and indisputable claim over the region's throne wins the game!

* **EXPLORE**: The fog of war forces the player to scout for surrounding regions and to go fetch information by themselves. Non-explored regions are not shown, while explored regions are shown, but then greyed out after some time.
* **EXPAND**: The kingdom gains power mostly by assimilating other kingdoms, which increases the controlled space and gives more opportunity of development to the ruler.
* **EXPLOIT**: Investing, building and making regions evolve is crucial to solidify acquired power and take advantage while stuck in a status quo.
* **EXTERMINATE**: Taking terrain is done by eliminating other rulers, kingdoms, and destabilizing other kingdoms is done by charming or eliminating travelers.
